Search for specific videos and channels.
Video recommendations based on user preferences.
Video playback controls (play, pause, seek, volume control).
Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices.

Usage
Obtain a Rapid API key to access the YouTube API.
Create a .env file in the project's root directory and add your API key as follows:

Start the development server by running the following command:

npm run dev

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 or according to your path by default. Open your web browser and visit that URL to use the YouTube clone.
